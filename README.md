# Signal Analysis for Fermilab Research Project

This repository contains code related to my signal analysis research project at Fermilab. The primary purpose of this repository is to securely store and manage my code.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of signals obtained from various experiments conducted at Fermilab. The data and code stored here are integral to my ongoing research in the field of signal processing.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains sample data files used for signal analysis.
- `scripts/`: Includes scripts and Jupyter notebooks used for processing and analyzing the data. Currently, the main focus is on plotting data with FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) and Power Spectral Density (PSD), along with the original signal.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/signal-analysis-fermilab.git
